### Intro
Onedrop is a web based blood bank management system, where user can search blood anonymously, however for requesting blood or for registering into a camp a user need to be authenticated. The main idea is to connect all the blood banks and needy people on a single platform to help each other by saving lives and time.

A user can register on onedrop and request blood as well as register into a camp either as a donor or volunteer. For registering into a camp as a volunteer, the user can select a role of a volunteer as per their interest. For each successful request or transaction the user will receive a email which would be the proof for the same. The main goal was to learn Spring boot and Angular. This project was made to show what we have learned.

Download: ``git clone https://github.com/aps08/onedrop``

### Future
We have followed a monolithic approach to create the back-end, however now days [microservice architecture](https://spring.io/blog/2015/07/14/microservices-with-spring) is followed everywhere. So in future I [aps08](https://github.com/aps08) will be releasing a a modified version of the back-end using a microservice architecture, or a new project using micro-service.
